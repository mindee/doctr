# Contributing to docTR

Everything you need to know to contribute efficiently to the project.

## Codebase structure

- [doctr](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/doctr) - The package codebase
- [tests](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/tests) - Python unit tests
- [docs](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/docs) - Library documentation building
- [scripts](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/scripts) - Example scripts
- [references](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/references) - Reference training scripts
- [demo](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/demo) - Small demo app to showcase docTR capabilities
- [api](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/api) - A minimal template to deploy a REST API with docTR

## Continuous Integration

This project uses the following integrations to ensure proper codebase maintenance:

- [Github Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) - run jobs for package build and coverage
- [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) - reports back coverage results

As a contributor, you will only have to ensure coverage of your code by adding appropriate unit testing of your code.

## Feedback

### Feature requests & bug report

Whether you encountered a problem, or you have a feature suggestion, your input has value and can be used by contributors to reference it in their developments. For this purpose, we advise you to use Github [issues](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/issues).

First, check whether the topic wasn't already covered in an open / closed issue. If not, feel free to open a new one! When doing so, use issue templates whenever possible and provide enough information for other contributors to jump in.

### Questions

If you are wondering how to do something with docTR, or a more general question, you should consider checking out Github [discussions](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/discussions). See it as a Q&A forum, or the docTR-specific StackOverflow!

## Developing docTR

### Developer mode installation

Install all additional dependencies with the following command:

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pre-commit install
```

### Commits

- **Code**: ensure to provide docstrings to your Python code. In doing so, please follow [Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) so it can ease the process of documentation later.
- **Commit message**: please follow [Udacity guide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

### Unit tests

In order to run the same unit tests as the CI workflows, you can run unittests locally:

```shell
make test
```

### Code quality

To run all quality checks together

```shell
make quality
```

#### Code style verification

To run all style checks together

```shell
make style
```

### Modifying the documentation

The current documentation is built using `sphinx` thanks to our CI.
You can build the documentation locally:

```shell
make docs-single-version
```

Please note that files that have not been modified will not be rebuilt. If you want to force a complete rebuild, you can delete the `_build` directory. Additionally, you may need to clear your web browser's cache to see the modifications.

You can now open your local version of the documentation located at `docs/_build/index.html` in your browser
